# **Binary Femboys Harmony Patcher**

This tool is a proof of concept of a c# string patcher using the [Harmony Library](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony/tree/master). It can swap strings such as authentication information.

## **Requirements**

- Windows OS
- .NET framework 4.8
- Visual Studio

## **How to Use**

1. **Set Up:** Verify that the assembly you want to patch is actually made in .NET.

2. **Edit the Code:** Edit the strings with your own authentication informations.

3. **Compile the Code:** Compile it in the right version for it to work with your assembly.

4. **Use the Tool:** Drag and drop the assembly you want to patch in the compiled executable.

## **How to Prevent This**

Obfuscate your program well, pack it into native/use AOT compilation and add anti-tamper measures.

## **DMCA VIOLATIONS**
